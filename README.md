# fictional-construction-company

Fictional Construction Company is a website written with the BEM methodology. Design is not the end result, but the backend coding style, methodologies and packaging. This is the result of learning web development in a 3 month span of time. BEM practices came naturally shortly after learning SASS and coding more than a few websites.
